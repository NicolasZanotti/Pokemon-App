# Pokemon-App

This is a private repository where I implement the same simple app in multiple frameworks.

## Challenge

Create a component that lists Pok√©mon names. The component should:

* show 10 names at a time
* allow stepping until an offset of 50
* have a loading state
* handle  spamming the buttons

The API call is: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=10&offset=10`
